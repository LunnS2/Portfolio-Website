        <p className="text-lg">
          Hi, I'm Tiagoâ€”a Full-Stack Web Developer based on the sunny shores of
          Madeira Island, Portugal. With 5 years of hands-on experience in
          building dynamic, real-world applications, I thrive at the
          intersection of creativity and technology, crafting solutions that are
          as functional as they are impactful.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-lg">
          My journey began with a Vocational Diploma in Multimedia Technology
          and accelerated through a Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, where I
          honed my skills in modern frameworks. Over the years, I've blended
          academic rigor with self-directed learning, tackling projects ranging
          from real-time chat applications to scalable social networks and
          self-care platforms. Whether developing client websites or personal
          projects, I prioritize clean code, intuitive design, and seamless user
          experiences.
